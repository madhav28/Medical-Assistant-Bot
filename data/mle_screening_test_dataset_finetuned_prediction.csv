What is (are) Exogenous ochronosis ?,"Exogenous ochronosis refers to the bluish-black discoloration of certain tissues, such as the ear cartilage, the ocular (eye) tissue, and other body locations when it is due to exposure to various substances. It has been reported most commonly with topical application of hydroquinones to the skin. The discoloration may be caused by an effect on tyrosinase (an enzyme located in melanocytes, which are skin cells that produce pigment), or by inhibiting homogentisic acid oxidase, resulting in the accumulation and deposition of homogentisic acid (HGA) in cartilage. The discoloration is often permanent, but when exogenous ochronosis is caused by topical hydroquinones, carbon dioxide lasers and dermabrasion have been reported to be helpful. Exogenous ochronosis is different from hereditary ochronosis, which is an inherited condition that occurs with alkaptonuria."," Exogenous ochronosis is a rare, pigmentation disorder caused by the deposition of a dark-brown to black pigment in the skin, cartilage, and other tissues. This pigmentation is due to the accumulation of a substance called benzopyrene quinone, which is a metabolite of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

The condition is typically associated with long-term exposure to high levels of PAHs, which are found in certain occupational settings, such as coal tar, creosote, and certain types of ink. It can also be caused by the use of certain medications, such as phenacetin and chloroquine.

The symptoms of exogenous ochronosis include darkening of the skin, particularly on sun-exposed areas, and the development of dark patches on the skin. The pigmentation can be permanent and may progress over time.

Treatment for exogenous ochronosis is typically focused on reducing exposure to the causative agent and managing symptoms. There is no known cure for the condition. Prevention is key, and individuals at risk of"
Is Hemifacial microsomia inherited ?,"Is hemifacial microsomia inherited? Hemifacial microsomia most often occurs in a single individual in a family and is not inherited. If the condition is caused by a chromosomal abnormality, it may be inherited from one affected parent or it may result from a new abnormality in the chromosome and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In a very small number of cases, hemifacial microsomia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In rare cases, the condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of a gene in each cell have mutations. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. The gene or genes involved in hemifacial microsomia are unknown. In some affected families, people seem to inherit an increased risk of developing hemifacial microsomia, not the condition itself. In these cases, some combination of genetic changes and environmental factors may be involved."," Hemifacial microsomia is a congenital condition, meaning it is present at birth. However, the exact cause of this condition is not fully understood. While some cases may be associated with genetic mutations, most cases occur sporadically and are not inherited. It's important to note that the majority of cases are not associated with any known genetic mutations.

In some cases, there may be a family history of similar conditions, but these cases are rare. If you have concerns about a potential genetic component in your family, it's best to consult with a genetic counselor or a healthcare provider who specializes in genetics. They can provide more specific information based on your family history and medical records.</s>"
Is Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome inherited ?,"How is Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome inherited? Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome (NCBRS) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that having a change (mutation) in only one of the two copies of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition. All known cases of NCBRS have been sporadic. This means it is thought that the mutation occurred for the first time in each affected person (called a de novo mutation). There have not been reports of NCBRS being inherited from a parent, or recurring in any family (with the exception of one pair of identical twins)."," Yes, Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that a mutation in one copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. If one parent has the mutation, there is a 50% chance that each child will inherit the mutation and have the disorder. However, some cases of Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome may occur due to new mutations in the gene and may not be inherited from a parent.</s>"
What are the symptoms of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ?,"The signs and symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) develop over time. They may not even begin to appear until the disease has done serious damage to your lungs. Once they occur, they're likely to get worse over time.
                
The most common signs and symptoms are:
                
Shortness of breath. This usually is the main symptom of IPF. At first, you may be short of breath only during exercise. Over time, you'll likely feel breathless even at rest.
                
A dry, hacking cough that doesn't get better. Over time, you may have repeated bouts of coughing that you can't control.
                
Other signs and symptoms that you may develop over time include:
                
Rapid, shallow breathing
                
Gradual, unintended weight loss

Signs and symptoms vary but may include microcephaly, developmental delay with lack of voluntary motor development, intellectual disability and movement disorders (i.e. chorea, dystonia, and spasticity). Affected people may also experience dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), impaired vision, seizures and an inability to communicate. Children with this condition often pass away prior to age 10 years, although survival beyond age 20 years has been reported. PCH2 is caused by changes (mutations) in the TSEN54, TSEN2, TSEN34, or SEPSECS gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Treatment is supportive and based on the signs and symptoms present in each person."," Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 2 (PCH2) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the cerebellum, a part of the brain that controls coordination and balance. It is characterized by the underdevelopment or hypoplasia of the cerebellum and its connections to other parts of the brain.

What is the outlook for Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia ?,Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on:         - The age of the patient.    - The subtype of AML.    - Whether the patient received chemotherapy in the past to treat a different cancer.    - Whether there is a history of a blood disorder such as myelodysplastic syndrome.    - Whether the cancer has spread to the central nervous system.    - Whether the cancer has been treated before or recurred (come back).         It is important that acute leukemia be treated right away.," Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. The outlook for AML can vary greatly depending on several factors, such as the patient's age, overall health, the specific type of AML, and the response to treatment.

The prognosis for AML is generally poor compared to other types of leukemia. However, recent advances in treatment have improved the outlook for some patients. For example, targeted therapies and stem cell transplants have shown promise in certain cases.

The most common treatment for AML is chemotherapy, often combined with other treatments such as stem cell transplants or targeted therapies. The goal of treatment is to achieve remission, which means that the leukemia cells are no longer detectable in the blood or bone marrow.

The five-year survival rate for AML is around 25-30%, but this can vary widely depending on the factors mentioned above. For older patients or those with poor health, the survival rate may be lower. For younger patients with certain types of AML, the survival rate may be higher.

What is (are) Pheochromocytoma ?,"Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that usually starts in the cells of one of your adrenal glands. Although they are usually benign, pheochromocytomas often cause the adrenal gland to make too many hormones. This can lead to high blood pressure and cause symptoms such as        - Headaches    - Sweating    - Pounding of the heart    - Being shaky    - Being extremely pale       Sometimes pheochromocytoma is part of another condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (MEN). People with MEN often have other cancers and other problems involving hormones.     Doctors use lab tests and imaging tests to diagnose it. Surgery is the most common treatment. Other options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.    NIH: National Cancer Institute"," Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that develops from the cells of the adrenal gland, specifically the adrenal medulla. The adrenal gland has two parts: the cortex and the medulla. The cortex produces hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, while the medulla produces epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline).

Pheochromocytomas are made up of cells that produce and store these catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). These tumors can grow large enough to cause problems by pressing on nearby organs, or they can release excessive amounts of catecholamines into the bloodstream, leading to a condition called paroxysmal hypertension (sudden, recurrent high blood pressure).

Symptoms of pheochromocytoma can include headaches, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, and high blood pressure. The diagnosis is typically made through a combination of blood and urine tests, as well"
What are the genetic changes related to dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency ?,"Mutations in the DBH gene cause dopamine -hydroxylase deficiency. The DBH gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme dopamine -hydroxylase. This enzyme converts dopamine to norepinephrine, both of which are chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) that transmit signals between nerve cells.  DBH gene mutations result in the production of a nonfunctional dopamine -hydroxylase enzyme. People who lack functional dopamine -hydroxylase cannot convert dopamine to norepinephrine, which leads to a shortage of norepinephrine in the body. The lack of norepinephrine causes difficulty with regulating blood pressure and other autonomic nervous system problems seen in dopamine -hydroxylase deficiency."," Dopamine beta-hydroxylate (DBH) deficiency is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the DBH gene. This gene provides instructions for making the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase, which is necessary for the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine in the nervous system.

The DBH gene is located on chromosome 6 and contains 10 exons. Mutations in the DBH gene can result in a deficiency of dopamine beta-hydroxylase, leading to an accumulation of dopamine and a deficiency of norepinephrine in the body.

Some of the common mutations associated with DBH deficiency include:

1. Deletions or duplications of exons: These mutations can result in a complete or partial deficiency of dopamine beta-hydroxylase.
2. Point mutations: These mutations can result in a change in the amino acid sequence of the enzyme, leading to a decrease in its activity.
3. Splicing mutations: These mutations can disrupt the normal splicing of"
What is (are) Persistent genital arousal disorder ?,"Persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) in men may be considered as the condition of priapism and unwanted ejaculatory fluids being released without any sexual interest. In women there is still no consensus about a formal definition, but some of the experts propose that in women it should be defined as a rare, unwanted, and intrusive sexual dysfunction associated with excessive and unremitting genital arousal and engorgement in the absence of sexual interest. The persistent genital arousal usually does not resolve with orgasm and causes personal distress. Features include excessive excitement or excessive genital (lubrication, swelling, and engorgement) or other somatic responses. Causes may be neurological (central or peripheral involving the pudendal nerve), related to medication, vascular, hormonal, psychological or others.  Diagnosis of the cause is essential for an adequate patient management. The treatment may include avoiding offending medications, using medications that stabilize nerve transmission and/or effect mood, local topical anesthetic agents, ice and hormonal replacement. More recently PGAD has being described as one component of a broader Restless Genital Syndrome if the PGAD was also associated with urinary frequency/urgency and restless leg syndrome."," Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder (PGAD) is a rare condition characterized by persistent, unwanted, and intrusive sexual arousal that is not associated with sexual desire or pleasure. The arousal can be constant or intermittent, and it can be distressing and disruptive to a person's daily life.

The exact cause of PGAD is not known, but it is thought to be related to dysfunction in the nervous system. It is more common in women, but it can also occur in men. Treatment options for PGAD include medications, physical therapy, and counseling.

It is important to note that PGAD is a real and valid medical condition, and it should be taken seriously. If you are experiencing persistent genital arousal that is causing distress, it is important to seek medical advice from a healthcare professional.</s>"
What is (are) Calciphylaxis ?,"Calciphylaxis is a disease in which blood vessels (veins and arteries) become blocked by a build-up of calcium in the walls of the vessels, preventing blood from flowing to the skin or internal organs.  The lack of blood flow (ischemia) damages healthy tissue and causes it to die (necrosis).  The most obvious and frequent symptom of calciphylaxis is damage to the skin, as ulcers can develop and become infected easily.  Calciphylaxis can also affect fat tissue, internal organs, and skeletal muscle, causing infections, pain, and organ failure.  These symptoms are often irreversible, and many individuals with calciphylaxis may not survive more than a few months after they are diagnosed due to infection that spreads throughout the body (sepsis), or organ failure.  The exact cause of calciphylaxis is unknown.  Treatments may include medications to reduce pain, antibiotics to treat infections, and various approaches to preventing the development or worsening of this condition."," Calciphylaxis is a rare and serious condition characterized by the deposition of calcium in the small blood vessels, leading to the formation of calcified plaques in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. This results in ischemic necrosis (tissue death) of the affected areas, causing severe pain, skin ulcers, and gangrene.

Calciphylaxis is most commonly seen in patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly those on dialysis, and in individuals with a history of long-term anticoagulation therapy, malnutrition, or immobility. The exact cause of calciphylaxis is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to an imbalance in the regulation of calcium and phosphorus metabolism, as well as an increased production of vitamin D.

The symptoms of calciphylaxis include painful, purplish or brownish skin lesions, usually on the lower limbs, but they can also appear on the trunk, breasts, and upper limbs. The lesions may start as small, red, tender spots and progress to deep, painful ulcers with a purple or brownish discolor"

                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

Is acute promyelocytic leukemia inherited ?,Acute promyelocytic leukemia is not inherited but arises from a translocation in the body's cells that occurs after conception.," Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is not typically inherited. It is a type of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that arises from an abnormality in a single cell in the bone marrow. The abnormality is a translocation of chromosomes 15 and 17, which results in the production of a fusion protein called PML-RARα. This fusion protein disrupts normal cell growth and differentiation, leading to the development of APL.

While the exact cause of APL is not known, it is not passed down through families like some other types of cancer. However, it is important to note that individuals with a family history of APL or other types of leukemia may have an increased risk of developing the disease.

If you have concerns about your risk of developing APL or other types of cancer, it is important to speak with your healthcare provider. They can help you understand your risk factors and provide guidance on steps you can take to reduce your risk.</s>"
What are the symptoms of Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ?,"What are the signs and symptoms of Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? The Human Phenotype Ontology provides the following list of signs and symptoms for Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. If the information is available, the table below includes how often the symptom is seen in people with this condition. You can use the MedlinePlus Medical Dictionary to look up the definitions for these medical terms. Signs and Symptoms Approximate number of patients (when available) Abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis - Arrhythmia - Asymmetric septal hypertrophy - Autosomal dominant inheritance - Congestive heart failure - Subaortic stenosis - Sudden death - The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has collected information on how often a sign or symptom occurs in a condition. Much of this information comes from Orphanet, a European rare disease database. The frequency of a sign or symptom is usually listed as a rough estimate of the percentage of patients who have that feature. The frequency may also be listed as a fraction. The first number of the fraction is how many people had the symptom, and the second number is the total number of people who were examined in one study. For example, a frequency of 25/25 means that in a study of 25 people all patients were found to have that symptom. Because these frequencies are based on a specific study, the fractions may be different if another group of patients are examined. Sometimes, no information on frequency is available. In these cases, the sign or symptom may be rare or common."," Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disorder that affects the heart muscle, causing it to thicken.
