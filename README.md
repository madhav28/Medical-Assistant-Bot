## üìö Dataset Preparation
To improve the quality of the responses, I have augmented approximately 100K PubMed abstracts from 2023 and 2024. I used these 100K abstracts along with the mle_screening_dataset.csv to create a vector store. For QLoRA fine-tuning of Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, I used a sample of 200 question-and-answer pairs as my training, validation, and testing datasets. I split the 200 samples into 160 for training, 20 for validation, and 20 for testing.

### Download PubMed Abstracts
**Download scripts for PubMed Abstracts:** [pubmed_download_scripts](./pubmed_download_scripts)

By running the above scripts, a total of ~ 3M abstracts with PMIDs will be downloaded. After downloading the abstracts, I randomly sampled 100K abstracts for this project.

## üóÉÔ∏è Vector Store
**Code:** [vector_store](./vector_store/)

Converted texts (PubMed abstracts and Answers) into a FAISS vector store for efficient semantic search. Key steps:

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
  - Combines two datasets:  
    - PubMed abstracts (`PMID` as identifier, `Abstract` as content)  
    - Q&A pairs (converted to documents with `row_<idx>` identifiers)  
  - Drops empty content and logs total document count  

- **Text Chunking**  
  - Splits documents using a science-aware `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`:  
    - Chunk size: 600 tokens  
    - Overlap: 150 tokens  
    - Prioritizes splits at paragraphs (`\n`), sentences (`.\s+`), and clauses (`;,\s+`)  

- **Embedding Generation**  
  - Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer (HuggingFace)  
  - Auto-detects GPU/CPU for acceleration  
  - Normalizes embeddings and processes in large batches (4096)  

- **Vector Store Creation**  
  - Indexes chunks in FAISS for optimized similarity search  
  - Saves output to `pubmed_vector_index` for reuse  

pubmed_vector_index: https://michiganstate-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/lellaom_msu_edu/Documents/Medical-Assistant-Bot/vector_store/pubmed_vector_index?csf=1&web=1&e=h2I2hS

**Question:** What are the causes and treatments for chronic back pain?<br>
**Bot Answer:**<br>
Chronic back pain is a common condition that can be caused by a variety of factors. Here are some of the most common causes:

1. Muscle or ligament strain: This is often caused by heavy lifting, poor posture, or sudden movements.
2. Herniated disc: This occurs when the soft inner material of a disc in the spine bulges out and presses on a nerve.
3. Osteoarthritis: This is a degenerative joint disease that can affect the spine.
4. Skeletal imbalance: This can cause uneven wear and tear on the spine, leading to chronic pain.
5. Spinal stenosis: This is a narrowing of the spinal canal that can put pressure on the spinal cord and nerves.
6. Fractures: Fractures in the spine can cause chronic pain, especially in older adults.
7. Infections: Infections in the spine can cause chronic pain.
8. Degenerative disc disease: This is a condition in which the discs in the spine break down and lose their cushioning ability.

Treatment for chronic back pain depends on the underlying cause. Here are some common treatments:

1. Pain medication: Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, can help relieve pain. Prescription pain medication may be necessary for more severe pain.
2. Physical therapy: Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles in the back and improve flexibility, which can help reduce pain.
3. Exercise: Regular exercise can help improve back strength and flexibility, which can help reduce pain.
4. Heat and cold therapy: Applying heat or cold to the affected area can help relieve pain.
5. Injections: Injections of corticosteroids or other medications can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain.
6. Surgery: In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct a structural problem in the spine.
7. Lifestyle changes: Making lifestyle changes, such as improving posture, losing weight, and quitting smoking, can help reduce the risk of chronic back pain.
8. Alternative therapies: Alternative therapies, such as acupuncture, massage, and chiropractic care, may help relieve pain.

**Question:** How can I improve my cardiovascular health?<br>
**Bot Answer:**<br>
Improving cardiovascular health involves adopting a balanced lifestyle that includes regular exercise, a healthy diet, and avoiding harmful habits. Here are some specific steps you can take:

1. Regular Exercise: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming, most days of the week. Incorporate strength training exercises into your routine at least twice a week.

2. Healthy Diet: Focus on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Limit saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, added sugars, and sodium. Consider incorporating foods that are high in fiber, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants.

3. Maintain a Healthy Weight: Excess weight can put a strain on your heart. Aim for a healthy body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-24.9.

4. Limit Alcohol: Drinking too much alcohol can raise blood pressure and lead to other heart problems. If you choose to drink, do so in moderation.

5. Quit Smoking: Smoking damages your heart and blood vessels, increasing your risk of heart disease and stroke.

6. Manage Stress: Chronic stress can contribute to heart disease. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.

7. Regular Check-ups: Regularly visit your healthcare provider for check-ups. They can monitor your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar levels, and provide guidance on maintaining a healthy heart.

8. Control Chronic Conditions: If you have conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol, managing them effectively can help reduce your risk of heart disease.

9. Take Medication as Prescribed: If your healthcare provider prescribes medication to manage your heart health, take it as directed.

10. Get Enough Sleep: Lack of sleep can contribute to high blood pressure, weight gain, and other risk factors for heart disease. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.

**Question:** What is Down Syndrome?<br>
**Answer:**<br>
Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder caused when abnormal cell division results in an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21. This extra genetic material causes the developmental changes and physical features of Down Syndrome.

Individuals with Down Syndrome may have a range of physical and developmental challenges, including cognitive delays, distinctive facial features, and a shortened lifespan compared to the general population. However, it's important to note that each person with Down Syndrome is unique, and many can lead healthy, fulfilling lives with appropriate support and care.

Down Syndrome is the most common chromosomal condition diagnosed in infancy, and it occurs in approximately 1 in every 700 live births worldwide. It can affect anyone, regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic status.

Early intervention, education, and medical care can greatly improve the quality of life for individuals with Down Syndrome. With proper support, many people with Down Syndrome can live independently, work, and participate in community activities.
